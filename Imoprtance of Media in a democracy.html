        <h1> What is the importance of media in a democracy? </h1>
<p1 size= "4">In a democracy, the media plays a very important
role in providing news and discussing events taking
place in the country and the world. It is on the basis
of this information that citizens can, for example,
learn how government works. And often, if they wish
to, they can take action on the basis of these news
stories. Some of the ways in which they can do this
is by writing letters to the concerned minister,
organising a public protest public protest, public 
protest starting a signature campaign, asking the
government to rethink its programme, etc.
Given the role that the media plays in providing
information, it is important that the information be
balanced.

<h2> What is a Balanced report? </h2>
<p1 size ="4"> 
    A balanced report is one that
discusses all points of view of a particular story and
then leaves it to the readers to make up their minds. Writing a balanced report, however, depends on
the media being independent.

    <h2> What is an Independent media? </h2>
    <p1 Size = "4">
        An independent media
means that no one should control and influence its
coverage of news. No one should tell the media what can be included and what should not be included in
a news story.

<h2> Importance of an independent media </h2>
<p1 size = "4">
    An independent media is important in
a democracy. As you read above, it is on the basis of
the information that the media provides that we take
action as citizens, so it is important that this
information is reliable and not biased.

<h2> What is the reality of Independent media? </h2>
<p1 size = "4"> However, the reality is that media is far from
    independent. This is mainly because of two reasons.
    The first is the control that the government has on
    the media. When the government prevents either a
    news item, or scenes from a movie, or the lyrics of a
    song from being shared with the larger public, this
    is referred to as censorship. censorship There have been periods
    in Indian history when the government censored the
    media.While the government does continue to censor
    films, it does not really censor the media’s coverage
    of news. Despite the absence of censorship by the
    government, most newspapers nowadays still fail to
    provide a balanced story. The reasons for this are
    complicated. Persons who research the media have
    said that this happens because business houses
    control the media. At times, it is in the interest of
    these businesses to focus on only one side of the
    story. Media’s continual need for money and its links
    to advertising means that it becomes difficult for
    media to be reporting against people who give them
    advertisements. Media is, thus, no longer considered
    independent because of its close links to business.</p1>
